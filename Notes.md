Time (0-2000ms): Controls how long the delay is
Default: 500ms
Range: 0-2000ms
Ticks every 500ms
Feedback (0-100%): Controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back
Default: 50%
Higher values create more repetitions
Lower values create fewer repetitions
Mix (0-100%): Controls the balance between original and delayed signal
Default: 50%
0% = only original sound
100% = only delayed sound
The delay effect is now applied to the mixed audio before it's sent to the output. Let's test it:
Select a sound (either test tone or a rain sound)
Play the sound
Adjust the delay controls:
Try different delay times
Adjust feedback for more/less repetitions
Use mix to control the effect intensity
Let me know if the delay effect works as expected, and we can then move on to adding the next feature.

Adjust the delay parameters:
Time: 0-2000ms (try around 500ms for a clear echo)
Feedback: 0-100% (try around 50% for a nice repeating echo)
Mix: 0-100% (try around 50% to hear both the original and delayed sound)
The delay effect should now be clearly audible with the test tone. Let me know if you'd like to:
Adjust the delay parameters
Try different test tones
Make any other modifications to the effects
