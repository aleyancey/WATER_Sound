## Overview
this project focuses on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to modify audio, specifically water sounds, for potential use in an Auditory Wellness Application (AWA). Due to time constraints, the MVP demonstrates the setup for LLM fine-tuning and a simplified audio modification tool. The setup involves preparing the environment, loading audio data, and configuring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. The simplified tool showcases the programmatic application of "pulsate" or "echo" effects to water sound samples.
